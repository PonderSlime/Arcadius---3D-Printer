# Arcadius
## Overview
### PonderSlime's printer design
A 3D printer designed to be just like an arcade claw machine!

It will have an XY head movement system, featuring a standard belt based printer system for this! This means that it can move like a CoreXY, but isn't one!

As for the Z movement, it will feature a unique design of tape measures to lower the extruder to the level needed! It would probably use two or three heavy-duty tape measures retrofitted with motors for this!

The frame will be fairly similar to CoreXY printers, but with a stationary bed!
