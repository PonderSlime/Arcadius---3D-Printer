# Arcadius
## Overview
### PonderSlime's printer design
A 3D printer designed to be just like an arcade claw machine!

It will have an XY head movement system, featuring a standard belt based printer system for this! This means that it can move like a CoreXY, but isn't one!

As for the Z movement, it will be a regular bed movement system. I really wanted it to lower just the extruder, but this doesn't seem possible, so it wont have that. ðŸ˜­

Since I cannot create a very authentic claw movement system, I instead will have a claw-machine looking case for it! In addition, it will have the controls mounted front and center, like a claw machine!
Also, unlike an arcade claw machine, this will not have an autoclearing bed. Instead, you will have to lift the front of the enclosure in order to access the parts. The handle would be disguised as the output slot (you would reach in, and lift it upwards! (hinged, of course!))
The frame will be fairly similar to CoreXY printers, but with a stationary bed!
